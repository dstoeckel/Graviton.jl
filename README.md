# Graviton

This package provides Julia bindings for Graviton web services. An example of a
Graviton web service is the [GeneTrail2](https://genetrail2.bioinf.uni-sb.de)
server for the computation of (gene set) enrichments.

The package binds to the RESTful API provided by the server and allows to
seemlessly run Graviton jobs in a Julia environment.
